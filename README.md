# Drawing on screenshots

This repository contains an intuitive web application that allows users to upload two videos, control video playback, sync video playback positions, capture screenshots, draw on the videos and add text or voice notes to these screenshots. Users can then save and share their annotated videos and screenshots.

## Features

The Drawing on screenshots provides the following features:

Video Upload: Users can upload two videos using the intuitive interface. The uploaded videos are displayed one by one for easy comparison and annotation.

Video Playback: Users can control the playback of the videos, including play, pause and seek.

Annotated Screenshot Capture: Users can capture annotated screenshots of the videos at any point. The app saves the screenshots along with the annotations made by the user. This feature is useful for capturing key moments or creating visual references.

Annotation Drawing: Users can draw annotations directly on the screenshots. The app provides various drawing tools such as line, arrow line, curve, rectangle and text on the screenshots. This feature allows users to highlight specific areas of interest.

Text and Voice Notes: Users can add text or voice notes to the captured screenshots.

Save and Share: After annotating screenshots, users can save their work. Users can easily share their annotated content with others.
